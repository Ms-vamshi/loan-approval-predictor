## 🧠 Model Info

This project uses a Logistic Regression model trained on financial data.  
The model predicts loan approval based on input factors such as:

- Applicant Income  
- Co-applicant Income  
- Loan Amount  
- Loan Term  
- Credit History  
- Gender, Marital Status, etc.

You can replace `model.pkl` with your own model trained on a different dataset.
